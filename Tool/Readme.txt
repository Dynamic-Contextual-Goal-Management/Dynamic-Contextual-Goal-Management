Step 1: Extract all components from source folder.
Step 2: Run GoalLatticeUpdater.py file that will maintain a structure containing Nodes.
Step 3: Run GenerateLattice.py file to construct a structure to represent connections between multiple nodes.
Step 4: Run CreateGoalModels.py file to create goal model variants.
Step 5: Run UploadGoalModelsInAWS.py file to upload generated goal model variants in AWS S3 cloud storage.
Step 6: LatticePlot3D.py file to visualize different nodes and their interconnections in 3D Plot.
